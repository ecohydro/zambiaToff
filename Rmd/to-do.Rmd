# Data and Improvements Needed

For the next iteration of the model and the ProcRoyalB paper.

## Improvements

A table of things to do, stating their progress and likelihood of achieving ("D" = doing, "L" is likely to get done, "U" is unlikely to get done, "F" is finished, "A" is abandoned) during the month of January.  __Table last updated: `r Sys.Date()`__

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19997242/simple-manual-rmarkdown-tables-that-look-good-in-html-pdf-and-docx
# tabl <- "  
# | Item        | Description           | Doing or Done?  |
# |---------------|:-------------|------|
# | Plausible scenario | A single production target to follow (Alastair)  | Doing |
# | Gridded yield estimates | Maize and soybean, exact method for handling variability & production zones (e.g. irrigation regions) |  Doing |
# | Gridded yield estimates | Run with improved soil profiles (Di) | Unlikely |
# | Upgrade soils | With ILUA database (with Nate?) | Unlikely |
# | Filter terrain | Get rid of unfarmable bits, probably needs new model logic (cell fraction multiplier) | Doing |

```

*Just using total production estimates, which will not be mapped for now. These will be basis for estimating production targets.
