\section*{\Large SI Results}

\section*{\large Potential displacements caused by cropland allocation routine}
To assess the degree to which the model's cropland allocation routine impacts the areas selected for conversion for each crop (see SI Methods for details), we ran the model separately for each crop, using the same parameters applied in the main analysis for the yield maximization scenario. We then assessed the overlap in the resulting areas selected for conversion for each crop in the resulting output maps (Figure 1). The results indicated that the two crops were allocated to the same areas in $<$1\% of converted pixels. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]

        \end{center}
      \caption{The distribution of converted areas when the model is run separately for maize and soybean when 100\% is placed on yield maximization. The map is color-coded according to which crop was allocated to each location (red for maize, blue for soybean, and yellow for the places where both crops were allocated).}
